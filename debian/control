Description: sudo I/O log server
 A Go-based sudo I/O log server that implements the sudo_logsrv.proto
 protocol. It serves as an alternative to sudo's native sudo_logsrvd,
 capable of receiving and processing I/O logs from sudo clients
 (version 1.9.0+).
 .
 The server supports dual-mode operation: local storage mode (saves logs
 locally) or relay mode (forwards to upstream server). It includes full
 sudoers compatibility for log path customization, TLS support for secure
 log transmission, and store-and-forward caching when upstream servers
 are unavailable.
